## ✨ Features

* **Modern Dark UI:** Built with a sleek, professional interface using CustomTkinter.
* **Real-Time Terminal:** Live logging of every message deleted so you can track progress.
* **Safe Deletion:** Built-in rate-limit handling and a minimum 1.5s delay to protect your account from bans.
* **Multi-Threaded:** The app never freezes while the purge is running.



### **How to get your Token**
To use this tool, you need your Discord Authorization Token. Follow the visual guide below:
1. Open Discord in your browser.
2. Press `F12` to open Developer Tools.
3. Go to the **Network** tab and reload the page.
4. Filter for `authorization`.

## ⚠️ Safety Warning
* **Self-Bots:** Using self-bots is technically against Discord's Terms of Service. Use this tool at your own risk.
* **Rate Limits:** Do not set the delay lower than 1.5 seconds. Rapid deletions can lead to account flags.
* **Token Security:** Never share your Discord Token with anyone. It gives full access to your account.
